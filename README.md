Machine Learning Capstone project
1.	Project topic and description: Gaming News writes articles on video games, and needs a way to show similar or related game news the user might be interested in after reading an article. This project will create a recommendation page Gaming News can implement into their website.

2.	Project purpose and goals: To create a page that will show Gaming News users other games that are similar or related to the article they are reading.

3.	Descriptive method: We'll compute the cosine similarity between video games based on their features to identify groups of games that are similar to the article being read.
  
4.	Predictive or prescriptive method:  We're designing a machine learning model that can recommend video games based on similarities. By leveraging a cosine similarity matrix, our machine learning model will compare features within our video game database to predict and recommend titles that exhibit high similarity scores to a user's previously enjoyed games, providing a tailored list of game suggestions.
